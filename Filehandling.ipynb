It is primarily used for CPU-bound tasks like heavy computations or data processing, where dividing the work among multiple processes can significantly boost performance. Each process operates independently with its own memory space, overcoming Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limitation, which restricts threads from executing Python bytecode in parallel. This makes multiprocessing ideal for tasks requiring parallel execution to improve efficiency.\n",
